# Homework 1 - The Fabulous Mathemagician

* Example code from lecture 1 can be used as a basis.
* Make sure you understand what each piece that you do use is doing and pick
  only the part that are necessary to fulfil these requirements.
* Read through **all the requirements** carefully, there are a lot of them
* Ask any questions in the course Slack workspace

## Configure initial project

* Create *index.html* 
  * Must include one JavaScript file (e.g /public/app.js) in document *head*
  * The JavaScript file must be executed after *DOM* has loaded
  * Set a *title* (_The Fabulous Mathemagician_) to the document
* Specify ALL your dependencies in *package.json*
* `yarn install && yarn build:watch` must serve your application on `localhost:10001`
* `yarn install && yarn test` must lint your source files (including test/ folder) and run unit tests

## Building

* Use Rollup as the build tool
  * Configure Rollup to output one JS file (e.g ./public/app.js)
  * Configure Rollup to use babel as a transpiler for JavaScript files
  * Configure Rollup to include source maps in the JavaScript bundle
* Configure Babel to output JavaScript that is
  * compatible with browsers with *equal to or more than 5% market share* according to browserlist
* Configure eslint
  * Configure to work with babel (_@babel/eslint-parser_)
  * Set "browser" as target environment
  * Use eslint and/or google recommended rules
  * Validate imports (_eslint-plugin-import_)
  * Lint your tests! (Create a different _eslint_ configuration file for the _test/_ folder)
* When localhost:10001 is open and any source file (not build configuration) is changed, the page should reload automatically.

## Unit tests

* Use mocha as a test runner
* Use chai as an assertion library
* Create at least 2 unit tests

## Mathemagician game

* 3 rounds, one expression displayed every round
* Each expression is a sum of 2 random digits (0-9)
* Game progresses to the next round when the correct answer has been input to the text input
* Game ends after 3rd round, with the total time spent displayed in milliseconds
* Use at least one class to implement game behaviour
* Align the elements to center with readable space in-between using **flexbox**
* Use `2em` as font-size

## Style and submission

* For your own sanity, use a version control system (learn if you have to!).
* Use any editor of your liking, but don't include its configuration files in the submission
* **Don't** leave this to the last minute (really!)
* **Don't** include node_modules/ nor any other autogenerated files in your submission (also exclude them from source control)
* Make sure you have no JavaScript lint errors or warnings.
* Use CamelCase for variable, file and class naming (except CSS selectors).
* zip your files together (**don't include node_modules/, public/ or .git/ or .hg/!**) and submit the zip file on the course submission page

## Pre-submission sanity check

* Delete node_modules/ directory and JavaScript and CSS files from the public/ directory
* Run `yarn install && yarn lint && yarn test` and check that your tests pass
* Run `yarn build:watch` and check that your application works as expected
