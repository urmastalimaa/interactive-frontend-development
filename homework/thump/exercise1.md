# Homework 1 - The Human Metronome Project

* Example code from lecture 1 can be used as a basis.
* Make sure you understand what each piece that you do use is doing and pick
  only the part that are necessary to fulfill these requirements.
* Read through **all the requirements** carefully, there are a lot of them
* Ask any questions on message-board

## Configure initial project and specify dependencies

* Create *index.html* 
  * Must include one JavaScript file (e.g /public/app.js) in document *head*
  * The JavaScript file must be executed after *DOM* has loaded
  * Set a *title* (_The Human Metronome Project_) to the document
* button
  * Create a button using `Document.createElement` which displays _milliseconds
    differing from a full second at the time of the click_ in index.js.
    * e.g when user clicks the button at `15 April 12:04:55.038`, the button
      should display `38`
  * The button must also display the number of clicks so far after the time difference.
  * Define a class `Metronome` with methods `createTimeDiff` and `getCount`. Put the class in a separate source file.
  * Add at least 2 unit tests for `Metronome`.
  * Create an instance of `Metronome` in index.js and use it to display the button
  * Align button to horizontal center using **flexbox**
* Use *webpack 4* as a build tool and development server
  * Configure Webpack to output one JS file (e.g ./public/app.js)
  * Configure Webpack to use babel as a transpiler for JavaScript files
  * Configure Webpack to include source maps in the JavaScript bundle
* Configure Babel to output JavaScript that is
  * compatible with browsers with *equal to or more than 3% market share* according to browserlist
* Configure eslint
  * Configure to work with babel (_babel-eslint_)
  * Set "browser" as target environment
  * Use eslint and/or google recommended rules
  * Validate imports (_eslint-plugin-import_)
  * Lint your tests! (You can have a different _eslint_ configuration for the _test/_ folder)
* Use mocha as a test runner
* Use chai as an assertion library
* Specify ALL your dependencies in *package.json*
* `yarn install && yarn start` must serve your application on `localhost:8080` (and optionally open the default web browser on that page)
* `yarn install && yarn test` must lint your source files (including test/ folder) and run unit tests
* When localhost:8080 is open and any source file (not build configuration) is changed, the page should reload automatically.

## Style and submission

* For your own sanity, use a version control system (learn if you have to!).
* Use any editor of your liking, but don't include its configuration files in the submission
* **Don't** leave this to the last minute (really!)
* **Don't** include node_modules/ nor any other autogenerated files in your submission (also exclude them from source control)
* Make sure you have no JavaScript lint errors or warnings.
* Use CamelCase for variable, file and class naming (except CSS selectors).
* zip your files together (**don't include node_modules/, public/ or .git/ or .hg/!**) and submit the zip file on the course submission page

## Sanity check

* Delete node_modules/ directory and JavaScript and CSS files from the public/ directory
* Run `yarn install && yarn lint && yarn test` and check that your tests pass
* Run `yarn start` and check that your application works as expected
