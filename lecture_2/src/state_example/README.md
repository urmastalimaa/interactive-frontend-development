## State in React

[React documentation on state][react-state].

The main way to pass data between React components is to use
_props_ which are immutable. In order to have data that changes,
_state_ must be used.

Mutable state and how applications react to mutations is generally hard to
understand. Therefore React limits the usage of _state_ to a single Component.
No other Components can read or change the state of other Components.

State can be initialized in the [class constructor][react-class-state]
or using the [useState hook][react-use-state]

## Components in the example

Build on top of the props example.

- [App](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive-frontend-development/tree/master/lecture_2/src/state_example/App.js)
  has local state now - a list of comments that grows every 3 seconds.
- [CommentList](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive-frontend-development/tree/master/lecture_2/src/state_example/CommentList.js)
  has been upgraded to take a list of comment objects as props.
